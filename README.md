# Student Faculty System

The Student Faculty System is a backend application designed to streamline and manage the interaction between students, faculty, and administrators. It is built with robust features like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), secure authentication, and authorization, ensuring that all actions are performed in a secure and controlled manner.

## Key Features:

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):

Implements role-specific permissions for Admin, Faculty, and Students.
Ensures users can only perform actions relevant to their role.
Admin: Full access to manage users, roles, and data.
Faculty: Restricted access to manage assigned courses, student performance, and communication.
Student: View-only access to personal information, grades, and course details, with options to update profile and interact with faculty.
Dynamic role assignment and permission updates.

## Authentication & Authorization:

Secure user authentication with encrypted credentials.
Token-based authorization (e.g., JWT or OAuth) to validate and manage session access.

## User Management:

CRUD operations for students, faculty, and admin profiles.
Centralized database for storing user details, courses, and academic records.

## Data Management:

Faculty can manage course details, student grades, and academic performance reports.
Students can track their progress, submit queries, and interact with faculty.

## Security Features:

Adheres to best practices for data protection, including encryption and validation mechanisms.
Prevents unauthorized access by validating permissions at every request.

## Scalability:

Modular design to allow future additions, such as extending roles or integrating third-party APIs.

## Use Cases:
Administrators efficiently manage users and roles.
Faculty securely handle academic activities and communication with students.
Students access personalized academic data and interact with faculty in a controlled environment.
This project demonstrates a well-structured backend system with a focus on security, role-based control, and user management to create a seamless and efficient academic management solution.
